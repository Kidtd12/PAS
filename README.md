# Property Management System (PMS)

## Overview

The **Property Management System (PMS)** is an asset and inventory management application designed to manage organizational properties, track stock, control storage locations, and handle store requisition workflows. The system provides structured processes for receiving items, inspecting them, storing them, and issuing them to staff through controlled approval workflows.

This project follows a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** structure and is intended to support scalable enterprise property management.

---

# Team Collaboration Workflow

Development is managed using **Git and GitHub branching workflow**.

Typical workflow:

1. Fork or clone repository
2. Create feature branch
3. Implement changes
4. Commit and push code
5. Create Pull Request
6. Review and merge to main branch

Example branches:

```
feature/domain-model
feature/requisition-module
feature/inventory-management
feature/user-authentication
```
